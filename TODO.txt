TODO

1.split each liblist line by space, and lookup in each path
- so we can specify multiple path to look for a lib
- useful when min/map files are not in the same dir.

2.what to do when sway requirements aren't available?
- install them? or tell user to install them?

3.checkcwd and init have gotten mixed together
- seperate them, cwdchk should only check cwd
- and in case it changed cwd, tell the user,
- and if it couldn't find the package.json, either promts for install or
- tell user you must run this first.

4.for release envs, grab the min files provided by vendors
- instead of doing it on our own.

5.release-light env js is broken, fix it.

6.temp-w in release envs, must cause a js-compile afterwards,
- since outjs is in one file.

7.make handlebars precompiled temps like:
- Handlebars.templates.name               => name.hbs
- Handlebars.templates.folder.name        => folder/name.hbs
- Handlebars.templates.folder.folder.name => folder/folder/name.hbs

8.make it possible to reference a lib somewhere other than src/lib,
- for libraries that are available in npm, but not in bower. (like pixi.js)
